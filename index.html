                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Anshi and I am a third-year student at UC San Diego, majoring in Computer Science. I am passionate about programming and both full-stack and back-end development, with experiences in mobile app development, as well. I have done extensive coursework in data structures, algorithms, and programming in Python and C++. In addition, I have industry level internship experience as a student consultant who worked on a project on blockchain technology. Currently seeking a SWE internship for summer 2024.</p>
